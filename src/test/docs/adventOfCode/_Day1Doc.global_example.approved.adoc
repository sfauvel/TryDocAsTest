For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

----
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
----

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by 5 Elves:

The Elf number 1 is carrying food with 1000, 2000 and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.

The Elf number 2 is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.

The Elf number 3 is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.

The Elf number 4 is carrying food with 7000, 8000 and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.

The Elf number 5 is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.

In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the Elf number 4).
